After ten month...
I still do not know how to use git.
So I decide to just copy them manually.

# First

Docker and Jupyter notebook(optional) 
should be on the host.

# Then
docker compose build

docker compose up

(maybe not quiet easy but something like that

# then
open a webbrowser and maybe put two pages side by side.
